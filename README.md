This is my final project for the Promineo Tech Back End Developer bootcamp. It is a web-base API design using Spring Boot and it is an application that allows for an enthusiast computer shop to create orders based off of their computer components and accessories. The API currently allows full CRUD operations to be performed on the Order entity and GET operations to be performed on all other entities. While the Order entity is limited in terms of what can be updated and read, this project is a work in progress and will continued to be updated in the future. The ultimate goal of this application is to allow full CRUD functionality to be performed on the orders and customers entities and to allow for pictures of different products to be returned alongside the information related to it.
